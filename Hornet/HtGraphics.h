// Modified 19/04/2024
// Added function to draw angledrectangles
// Set alpha blending from initialisation
// Added some comments to FillCircle to note limitations
// Modified 3/5/24 Altered Present so it always clears with background colour
// then uses the texture if there is one. This avoids issues
// with texture including colour key for transparency.
// Modified 5/6/24
// Added FillAngledRect
// Corrected bug in DrawTextCentred to make it actually centred
// Changed PictureIndex to prevent free casting with int. I was making that mistake too often
// Added BROWN
// Modified 6/6/24
// Corrected DrawPointList
// Modified 7/6/24
// LoadImage will try to load from "assets\"+file if it fails,
// in case programmer just forgot to add the folder path.
// Modified 10/6/24
// Fixed WriteTextCentered angle.
